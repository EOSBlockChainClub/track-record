## Track Record

Building track records towards new opportunites. An EOS Proto DApp begun at the San Francisco EOSHackathon.

## Motivation
Have you ever struggled to find a good job?   

You send out hundreds of resumes, do dozens of interviews and after months of searching, no luck.

But what if I told you about a platform that will make getting a job soo much easier.

Let’s take Jennifer the graphic designer from Italy for example.  

All she needs to do is enter her expertise so she can start building her immutable track record.  

Once she enters that in, jobs will just show up.  She can swipe left and right to find the preferred one.  There is a job title, description and the following terms:  
1) How much money she’s going to make

2) The time expected to complete the job – and because Isabella is new, she’ll only receive jobs that are for 1 week.  Once she builds her reputation she could receive jobs for 1yr or even longer.  

3) The key performance metrics or KPIs for success.  These will vary for each job.  

These terms will all be recorded on the blockchain.

Then she clicks a button and that’s it!  No interviews.. resumes.. contracts … she can just get started!  Isn’t that great?

Next Jennifer will start entering all her activities on the EOS blockchain… let’s say she uploads an initial draft of the website and then another revision after some feedback.   Step by step each work activity and the communications around it are recorded & timestamped on the blockchain.  Because of this radical transparency, algorithms can match her track record with future jobs. 

Finally when Jennifer has completed the task - she gets paid instantly.  In our example she gets paid in EURO stablecoins that were converted from US dollar stablecoins.  She can be paid anywhere in the world in any currency because of the automated conversions using a smart contract.  Isn’t that convenient?

Since Jennifer finished early she gets a time bonus.  She also exceeds her Key Performance Indictators (KPIs) and earns a performance bonus as well. 

The logic behind these bonus calculations will also be automated in another smart contract. 

So there you go.  One you start using Track Record you’ll never have to find a job again…because the jobs will come looking for you.
